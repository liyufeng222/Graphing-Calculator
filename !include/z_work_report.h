    Features:
        -Not Implemented:
              So far every thing has been implemented.
        -Implemented:
              The Link list extra credit, have function: insert head, insert
              after, search, next and previous in both node struct and
              List class, list also have begin function test node need create
              the head nullptr, but list can be construct by the default
              constructor.
        -Partly implemented: None
              None
    Bugs     :
              features that are implemented are bug-free.

    Reflections:
        Linked list is very similer to vector, it is a list, but different
        node have non-continuous address, need use the _next variable to
        find the next one.
